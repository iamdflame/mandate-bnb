# Operating Mandate

What a stranger needs to run the judge path from this repository.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and `.env.local`. Names only are listed there; no
value is ever committed. The ones that matter:

| Name | Needed for |
|---|---|
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | the principal and market owner; the demo account; x402 settlement |
| `ADJUDICATOR_KEY` | epoch proposals (a different key from the owner) |
| `AGENT_A_KEY`, `AGENT_B_KEY` | keeper bids; AGENT_A pays the x402 test |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | sealing and opening session signers (must match everywhere) |
| `OPERATOR_TOKEN` | the revoke form on /desk |
| `DATABASE_URL` | sessions, snapshots, leases, heartbeats |

To copy keys to Vercel without printing them: `bash scripts/vercel-env.sh NAME ...`.

## Deploy

```
vercel --prod
vercel alias set <the deployment url> mandate-coral.vercel.app
```

`vercel --prod` does not move the `mandate-coral` alias on its own. The project
must be linked as `mandate`. `.vercelignore` keeps `.sessions/` and every `.env*`
out of the upload; check it before adding any directory that holds a key.

## Scheduled work

GitHub Actions is refused on billing, so nothing there runs. What does:

- `/api/cron/tick`, called every five minutes by an external pinger with
  `CRON_SECRET`. It runs whichever jobs are due, in priority order, and stops
  starting new ones near the pinger's thirty seconds. Unauthenticated, it
  answers 401 with every job's last run, so anyone can see the clock is moving.
  The jobs, most urgent first:
  - `guard-1` every 10 min, `range-1` every 15 min, `yield-1` every 6 h: the
    house agents' turns (below).
  - `status` every 5 min (the six beats, and a row of history), `probe` every
    10 min (a census slice), `grid-window` every 30 min, `definition` every
    15 min, `sweeper` every 30 min (escrowed jobs), `leases` every 6 h,
    `heartbeat` every 15 min.
- `/api/cron/daily` (Vercel cron, 03:17 UTC): a census slice and a keeper sweep.
- After every judge-facing page render: a census slice if the reading is older
  than fifteen minutes (`src/lib/census/refresh.ts`).
- Point an external monitor at `/api/status` (200 or 503) and `/judges`.

### The house agents, and the two switches that let them spend

Range-1, Guard-1 and Yield-1 take a turn on the tick: they read the chain,
decide by their rule (`src/lib/house/range.ts`, `src/lib/house/venus.ts`) and
act through their own session on the demo account. Every turn is a row in the
`house_runs` table, including the many that decide nothing; `/desk` shows the
newest one per agent and `/activity` shows their actions. Grid-1 is paused
(`src/lib/market/paused.ts`) and never runs.

Two environment variables on the production deployment decide what may spend
money. Both are off unless set, and both are turned off by removing them and
redeploying.

| Variable | When set | What it spends |
|---|---|---|
| `HOUSE_AGENTS=live` | The agents send their transactions. Unset, they decide and record "would have done X" and send nothing. | Gas from the demo account (about 0.00002 BNB a transaction at 0.05 gwei), and the account's own tokens, never more than each session's daily cap: Guard-1 repays up to 0.05 USDT a day, Yield-1 supplies up to 0.1 USDT a day, Range-1 recenters inside RecipientBound's lifetime caps. |
| `LEASE_RENEWAL=on` | The `leases` job renews a house session three days before it expires, for 21 days. | One KeyStore registration per renewal, from the operator's balance, at most two a run. A paused agent's leash is never renewed. |

What an agent will not do, whatever the switches say:

- Grant itself a session. A lapsed leash stops it until the leases job or an
  operator renews it.
- Start a Range-1 recenter it cannot finish. RecipientBound's caps are for its
  whole life, and a withdrawal with no new range after it would strand the
  liquidity.
- Keep paying for a failing transaction. Three failures in a row stop it for
  six hours.
- Send without a minimum out. Range-1's withdrawal is bound 2% under what the
  position holds, and its mint on a 1% price band.
- Trust a receipt alone. Venus can land a call that did nothing, returning an
  error code instead of reverting, so a repay only counts if the debt fell and
  a supply only if the vUSDT balance rose.

To run one turn by hand: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
"https://mandate-coral.vercel.app/api/cron/tick?job=guard-1&force=1"`.

## Scripts

All take `run` to send; without it they print the plan.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/scripts/grid-window.ts run --hours 6` | Grid-1 trades a window through its session and SwapBound |
| `src/scripts/range-recenter.ts run` | Range-1 recenters the demo's out-of-range position |
| `src/scripts/prove-passkey.ts run` | a passkey wallet: grant, execute, revoke, sweep |
| `src/scripts/venus-agents.ts run both` | Yield-1 supplies, Guard-1 repays if under its trigger |
| `src/scripts/hire-strangers.ts run` | ERC-8183 jobs to agents we do not operate |
| `src/scripts/pick-trophy.ts` | draws the fourth stranger from block 121,200,000's hash |
| `src/scripts/pay-house.ts grid-1` | buys one answer over x402, 402 then 200 |
| `src/scripts/sessions.ts list` / `revoke <keyId>` | every key on the account, and ending one |
| `src/scripts/settle-jobs.ts run` | the settle sweeper: reads each stranger job, records a submitted deliverable and checks its hash, settles after the seven-day dispute window, refunds an expired unworked job |
| `src/scripts/register-reference.ts run` | registers Range-1, Grid-1, Yield-1, Guard-1 on ERC-8004, one key each |
| `src/scripts/add-agents.ts <tokenId ...>` | adds newly registered tokens to the committed index from the chain |
| `src/scripts/split-adjudicator.ts run` | moves the adjudicator role to a new key |
| `src/scripts/demo-inventory.ts run` | puts the demo address into its published state |
| `npm run smoke` | walks the six beats against production |

Run them as `npx tsx --env-file=.env --env-file-if-exists=.env.local <script>`.

## When a beat breaks

- **Beat 1 shows nothing out of range.** BNB moved far enough to bring a demo
  position into range. The two positions are 1,500 ticks either side of the
  price at mint, so this needs a move of about 16%. Mint a new one with
  `demo-inventory.ts`; do not recenter the out-of-range one the night before.
- **Beat 4 has no fills.** The runner stopped or the price has not crossed a
  level. `tail` its log; restart `grid-window.ts run`. Fills already on chain
  are never lost.
- **Beat 5 says "not registered" or "expiry differs".** The session in the store
  and the KeyStore disagree. `sessions.ts list` shows every key; revoke the
  stray one and re-grant.
- **A provider is failing.** `/status` shows it; reads skip it for a minute.
  Set `MARKET_RPC_URL` and `BSC_RPC_URL` to two paid providers to put them first.
- **The census is stale.** Load `/judges` once; the refresh runs after the
  response. `/api/cron/daily?job=census` forces one.
- **A stranger job shows SUBMITTED.** Its provider did the work. Settling pays
  them and is only possible once the policy's dispute window (604,800 s) has
  passed after submission; run `settle-jobs.ts run` after that. The SDK's
  `submittedAt` field reports the window's start, not the submission.
- **A key is on the account that /desk does not hold.** Treat it as a finding.
  `sessions.ts revoke <keyId> "<why>"`, and it is listed under keys that ended.
