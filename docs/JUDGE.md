# For judges

The whole walk is one page: **https://mandatemarkets.com/judges**. Six
beats, each a live control on BNB Smart Chain mainnet, starting from one
published address so you do not need a position of your own:
`0x54c06cC2623aAA2Dcc38B17fA07aD2e99b363C90`.

1. `/diagnose?q=<that address>`: positions out of range, a Venus health factor,
   idle cash, read from the chain with the block.
2. Four categories, each with our reference agent and its mainnet receipt beside
   the third-party agent that answered fastest.
3. `/agents/269706`: Agripinaa's Ranger, which we do not run, and the ERC-8183
   job we funded for it.
4. `/desk#grid-1`: Grid-1's real fills, read from SwapBound's events.
5. `/desk`: every key on the demo account beside the Altana KeyStore's answer.
6. The funnel, from the registry's own counter.

`/status` runs the reads behind all six and says which, if any, is broken.

## What needs a wallet

Reading, diagnosing and the six checks need nothing. Paying an agent, over x402
or ERC-8183, needs a wallet, because the money is real. We do not sponsor calls.

## Receipts

Every transaction is linked from the README's Receipts section and re-checked in
[`docs/verify/2026-09-11.md`](verify/2026-09-11.md).

## Do not use

- Any commit before 10 Sep 2026. A revert on 9 Sep put an assay-office front door
  in front of this marketplace.
- `/start`, `/floor`, `/market`, `/office/:category`, `/agent/:id`. They redirect.
- Testnet. Everything here is BSC mainnet.

## The honest list

The "What is not true yet" section of the README. In short: no stranger has
been paid yet (one has submitted work), the owner is still one EOA, BscScan
verification needs a key, the four bonded books are dust and held by our own
wallets, and Grid-1 has lost to doing nothing so far.
