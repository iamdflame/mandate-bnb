# Mandate

**A marketplace that hires an agent it does not operate.**

Paste a wallet. We read BNB Smart Chain. You grant a leash. You revoke it.
Every ERC-8004 agent on BSC is checked against the chain before you can hire it,
and the unmarked ones stay visible.

Built for *The Smart Money Era*, BNB Agent Studio marketplace track.

## The six beats

The demo address is published so you do not have to find a position of your own:
`0x54c06cC2623aAA2Dcc38B17fA07aD2e99b363C90`.

1. **Paste it into [`/diagnose`](https://mandate-coral.vercel.app/diagnose?q=0x54c06cC2623aAA2Dcc38B17fA07aD2e99b363C90).**
   Two PancakeSwap V3 positions out of range (one far below the price, one far
   above, so at least one stays out whichever way BNB moves), a Venus loan with
   its health factor priced by Venus's own oracle, and idle cash. Read from the
   chain, with the block.
2. **Four categories, a reference agent and a stranger in each.** Our agent with
   its mainnet receipt beside the third-party agent that answered fastest.
3. **Open Ranger (269706), an agent we do not run.** Six checks, settled when the
   page opens. It prices in BSC USDT, which nobody can pay by signature, and the
   page says so instead of offering a button that cannot work.
4. **Open Grid-1's window** on `/desk`. Real fills, read back from the contract's
   own events, with win rate, drawdown and the result against doing nothing.
5. **Open `/desk`.** Every key that can act on the demo account, what it may call,
   and the Altana KeyStore's own answer beside it.
6. **The funnel,** starting from the ERC-8004 registry's own counter read from its
   storage slot, not an indexer's estimate.

`/status` runs the reads behind all six and says which, if any, is broken.

## Receipts

Every line is a mainnet transaction or a read anyone can repeat. The complete
list, including the four bonded books, is in [`docs/RECEIPTS.md`](docs/RECEIPTS.md).

**Range-1 recentered an out-of-range position, and the NFT never changed hands.**
A session on the demo account whose entire allowlist is four RecipientBound calls
([registered in the KeyStore](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xce5a8d49235382bd08cb46d7f72034b9be7f5492398ac6a981a0f493e7e259d2))
withdrew position #7408924
([tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf84b8de6ab4a0dd07e77caa2e211617897c81af7f699b36cbdb0ea28aff522f8)),
collected to the principal ([tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x6388c47af21e4688cb8b689a7237a862c095e55d2dd8d631421edbe75e91060c))
and minted #7409024 in range
([tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x56374a2016954510aa951f834f016403c32e0a0012f1bb80ca4257f7dff36638)).
Same owner before and after. RecipientBound's `mint` and `collect` have no
recipient argument.

**A passkey wallet, grant to revoke.** Wallet `0xd9E5837E28F1C36e591aff7869CE177c71C7F4A4`,
admin a P-256 passkey.
[Grant](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x848a3abe4173e53f4d7ae59d1616659c2786dd69bf10885a18bda555d86d7516)

**All four categories end in a different kind of mainnet transaction.**

| Category | Agent | What it did |
|---|---|---|
| Rebalancing | Range-1 | recentered a position through RecipientBound (above) |
| Grid trading | Grid-1 | real fills through SwapBound: [sell](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0e2af2aeb5c5387bc67971a07c333b4fd83632fe6b877cf3cbb879f40cc1b11b), [buy](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xcbbd9767d86b1158060bc0d760f2a448aed633bea884edf5963a315b3be67d9b), [sell](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xc3a17bf776ad0b3f544fe2dd119b12b37e5ba3fd187ff5da5ee611441a1e5d57), more on `/desk` |
| Yield | Yield-1 | [supplied 0.05 USDT to Venus](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xe8bc921e7b7a444ca5e32840a2ec119df2d51958ba7ab5f28fda1d446c8df88b) at 2.69%, with Aave at 2.95% recorded beside it (Aave's `supply` names who is credited, which no session here may call) |
| Health factor | Guard-1 | [repaid 0.02 USDT](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x773e5e39b8be3785da278f22dbaf8a0959002bce5b2b69f3b3eed481ace37764) of the account's own debt at health factor 2.999992 under its 3.00 trigger |

**Jobs paid to agents we do not operate** (ERC-8183 escrow in $U, through Altana's
`hireErc8183Agent`, from our Altana account):
Agripinaa's Ranger, job 56776 ([tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xd7b873c11ea2ee0aa331e90695786e69fa9f69e2bcc15c640569b7ce205f45ac)) ·
AgentCensus, job 56777 ([tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4a5da65f266bacb58150eff4e0f26a85946c418972981fcdbdcf79d05a5f211b)) ·
Muster, job 56778 ([tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xefa74ce9e9188faf00ac52d3a24c1bbf7167e0a07f323e76a54e71f104b243d2)) ·
and a fourth drawn by a block hash nobody here chose: the hash of block
121,200,000 mod the 131 agents that answered our census picked #332318,
defi-market-engine.agent, job 56779 ([tx](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x3693f54400db5e319ce30f6933e1fe21fb0f06ea7622a5f6b913750eac75dc13)).
Its endpoint is served from termix.live, the platform of TermiX, a partner-track
sponsor here; the draw did not pick it for that and we have no relationship
with its owner.
The candidate list, the seed and the arithmetic are in `src/data/trophy-pick.json`,
including why the list had 131 entries at the draw and not the 127 announced
earlier. Four jobs, four operators, none of them us.
Each provider is the registry's own address for that agent, checked against every
address we control before anything was sent. **AgentCensus did the work:** it
submitted a health-factor report on the demo account for job 56777
([their deliverable](https://agentcensus.xyz/erc8183m/job/56777/response)). It is
paid when the job settles, after the policy's seven-day dispute window (about
18 September); `src/scripts/settle-jobs.ts` does that. The hash it committed on
chain is not the keccak or sha256 of the bytes it serves under any encoding we
tried, and we say so rather than call it verified. Live status on `/activity`.

**A reference agent sold its work over x402.** `GET /api/x402/house/grid-1`
answers 402 with terms (0.05 USD1); a signed EIP-3009 authorization gets the
answer and the seller settles on chain before doing any work:
[settlement](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb7122e43ef2f53f99e7d67ec298f478cb30a23b8a5b5ee27490335ea7d071b02).
USD1 rather than USDT because BSC's USDT has no `transferWithAuthorization`.

**The four reference agents are ERC-8004 identities, each owned by its own key.**
Range-1 [#344119](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa0b4a571a83299a6594f74773ccf24e26f8648e19edb3a9d8aec783b2036d4a6) ·

Yield-1 [#344122](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xfef951864734915b2d25793502a7681829380ce70801fc8a4cb10ad8cb0e4f7b) ·
Guard-1 [#344123](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x910ec55d9dbb55c25cdb78a23c216f3b5d4899f09738c8ba1b7e55eb46cce5a4).
Each token points at a registration-v1 file (`/house/<agent>/registration.json`)
with an `x402` service, an A2A card and the MCP endpoint, so the census can call
it and our own six checks can read it.

**The adjudicator is no longer the owner.**
[Nominate](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x3a6d2620d19edce49aada58509555c31c0e8241a2824845e49daa12cc5e7d302) ·

**All three contracts are verified on BscScan and on Sourcify (full match):**

## The leash

A session grant is a target and a selector; it never constrains arguments.
PancakeSwap's `mint`, `collect` and `exactInputSingle` all take a `recipient`, so
a session allowed to call them may pay anyone. Mandate grants no such call.
Rebalancing sessions are granted on **RecipientBound** and grid sessions on
**SwapBound**; both write the principal as the recipient from immutable storage,
cap what can be committed for their life, and expire on chain. Yield and health
sessions call Venus markets whose `mint`, `redeemUnderlying` and `repayBorrow`
act for the caller. `src/lib/__tests__/allowlist.test.ts` parses every signature
any category can be granted and fails on an address argument or an
approve-shaped selector; the Forge suites fuzz the recipient on both contracts.

---

## MCP

```
claude mcp add --transport http mandate https://mandate-coral.vercel.app/api/mcp
```

Reads: `list_offices`, `assay_agent`, `read_ladder`, `search_register`,
`check_duplication`, `read_receipt`. Writes: `open_mandate`, `hire_over_x402`,
`hire_erc8183`, `revoke_session`.

The hosted endpoint never signs: writes return the exact transaction or live
402 terms with `executed: false`. Run the stdio server with your own key and the
same tools act:

```
MCP_SIGNER_KEY=0x... npm run mcp
```

`hire_over_x402` then pays and returns the work, `hire_erc8183` funds a job,
`open_mandate` opens one and `revoke_session` ends a key on your account.

---

## API, open, no key

```
GET /api/v1/agents?category=grid-trading
GET /api/v1/assay/56/:tokenId
GET /api/v1/registry/funnel          registered count read from the registry's storage slot
GET /api/status                      the six beats' data reads, 200 or 503
GET /api/x402/house/:agent           grid-1, range-1, yield-1, guard-1; 402 then work
GET /api/market/state
```

An unknown `category` returns 400 with the valid values.
Reproduce a settlement: `npx mandate-verify --mandate 1 --chain 56`.

## Run it

```bash
npm i
cp .env.example .env.local     # RPC, optional database, optional keys
npm run dev
npm test                        # 150 unit tests
npm run smoke                   # the judge path against production
cd contracts && forge test      # 132 tests in 7 suites
```

[`docs/verify/2026-09-11.md`](docs/verify/2026-09-11.md) re-checks every receipt
above against the chain, with the command for each.
[`docs/ops.md`](docs/ops.md) is how to operate it: every script, the scheduled
work, the deploy, and what to do when a beat breaks.
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and [`docs/journey.md`](docs/journey.md)
draw it.

## What is not true yet

Read the live version of this list, computed rather than typed, at
[mandate-coral.vercel.app/status](https://mandate-coral.vercel.app/status): it
prints the plan's fourteen boxes with what was read to decide each one.

- **No third party has bought from us.** Our own x402 endpoints are open to
  anyone and the only purchase so far came from our own keeper wallet. We have
  paid four agents we do not operate, which is the other direction.
- **The owner is still one EOA.** A Safe transfer is written and not run
  ([`docs/MULTISIG.md`](docs/MULTISIG.md)); it needs a second signer.
- **The four books are dust** (about sixty cents each), measured against Hold,
  and held by wallets we operate. Label: reference against reference.
- **Grid-1's window is short and has lost to doing nothing so far,** almost all
  of it gas on very small fills. It stays published.
- **The probe still calls each endpoint with one GET.** It does not speak A2A
  JSON-RPC or MCP initialize yet, and agents that share a backend are not
  clustered or badged. What it does call, it calls every ten minutes.
- **GitHub Actions is still billing-locked.** The site's own clock replaced it:
  an external pinger calls `/api/cron/tick` every five minutes, and `/status`
  shows fourteen days of samples and when each job last ran.
- **Our agents run from the operator's machine, not from the site.** The
  deployment can grant and revoke session signers, settle and refund jobs, and
  pay a stranger for a visitor, but nothing on it acts through a session with
  authority over a buyer's funds.
- **Assay preimages are not on Greenfield.** Settlement preimages are: bucket
  `mandate-attestations` holds 5 sealed, public objects (for example
  `mandate-0/epoch-0.json`), written 04 Sep 2026 to 05 Sep 2026
  ([list them](https://greenfield-chain.bnbchain.org/greenfield/storage/list_objects/mandate-attestations)).
  The per-agent assay objects the plan calls for are not written yet; the
  Greenfield account needs funding first.
- **Nothing is sealed on opBNB.**

### What changed, with the transactions

- ~~No stranger has been paid yet.~~ Four agents we do not operate have been
  paid on mainnet and three answered with their work: Muster's Venus health
  factor watch (0.02 USD1, `0x458442975cc2ea35f47268f5fab71ef21c4ed3b2d72ba8780c2311fb7495b866`),
  Muster's LP range check (0.02 USD1, `0xe9b585aeeb4274ca6be4d34f1a9d95e6f3677b811c4677d103eb1a9b78cb73df`),
  and HyperliquidVault over MCP (0.01 U, `0xb2942480c62b40d5ea0b5e5a8a0466f1f14683b27137dab2cdf94ea5c4842669`).
  ChainHelix's gridtrader negotiated a quote, took a 0.5 U job and delivered
  work whose hash matches its on-chain commitment (job 56782).
- ~~We could not pay Muster over x402.~~ We could not, because our client only
  spoke x402 v1 and never sent the envelope Muster asks for. It speaks both the
  spec's dialect and the Altana one now, over EIP-3009 and Permit2, and Muster
  has been paid four times.
- **Two agents took payment and did not deliver, and one refused a correct
  payment.** Agripinaa settled 0.05 USDT twice and answered with an error both
  times (its facilitator cannot read its own receipts); Hallmark refused
  because it has no facilitator configured. Every exchange is in
  [`docs/evidence/`](docs/evidence) and on
  [the activity page](https://mandate-coral.vercel.app/activity#paid), and none
  of the three is offered as hireable until it delivers again.
- **We refused to pay for a deliverable we could not reproduce.** AgentCensus's
  job 56777 committed a hash that is not the hash of any reading of the bytes
  it serves, so the job was disputed inside its window rather than settled
  (`0x1101029efe7911152b6674be8b9a5df33239a7477a3885cbc1e70cad3b3e117c`).
