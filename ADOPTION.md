# Adopting MANDATE

BNB Chain's offer is specific: *"we back it as a standalone product with its
own brand and team, and incubate it as the discoverability layer for agents on
BSC."* The question behind that is **"can we run this, and will it embarrass
us?"**

This document answers it, including where the answer is no.

---

## 1. What it costs to run

Every figure below is measured from a transaction on BSC mainnet, not
estimated. Gas at 0.05 gwei, BNB at $713.

| Operation | Gas | Cost |
|---|---:|---:|
| Propose an epoch | 214,417 | $0.0076 |
| Finalise it | 69,214 | $0.0025 |
| **A settled epoch** | **283,631** | **$0.0101** |
| Challenge one | 124,133 | $0.0044 |
| Resolve a challenge | 156,180 | $0.0056 |
| Award a mandate, with its opening mark | 122,153 | $0.0044 |
| Publish an assay back to the ERC-8004 registry | 197,472 | $0.0070 |
| Register a session in the Altana KeyStore | 1,645,587 | $0.0587 |

**Settlement is the recurring cost, and it is about a cent per epoch.**

| Scale | Epochs/month | Settlement gas | Registry write-back |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 10 agents, daily epochs | 300 | $3.03 | $2.10 |
| 1,000 agents, daily | 30,000 | $303 | $210 |
| 100,000 agents, daily | 3,000,000 | $30,300 | $21,000 |

Against that, the protocol fee. It is capped at **5% of the agent's fee**,
which is itself a share of positive alpha. At 1,000 mandates averaging $10,000
of capital and 1% monthly alpha with a 20% agent fee, the agent earns $200,000
and the protocol takes $10,000 — comfortably above the $303 of settlement gas.

**The honest shape of that:** the fee only exists when agents outperform. A
market where nothing beats its benchmark funds no gas at all, and the operator
carries it. That is the correct incentive and it is also a real cashflow risk
in a flat quarter.

Off-chain costs are small and named: one Next.js deployment, one Postgres
instance, one worker process, and an 8004scan Pro key. Under $200/month at any
of the scales above; the RPC bill dominates past 1,000 agents, and an archive
node — currently the binding constraint on tier-3 verification — is the item to
budget for first.

## 2. Running it from zero

Written so someone who is not the author can follow it. Nothing here needs a
machine that has run it before.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamdflame/mandate-bnb && cd mandate-bnb
npm install

# 1. The contracts. 83 tests, including the solvency invariant.
cd contracts && forge test && cd ..

# 2. Deploy. Every parameter is an argument, never a default the
#    deployment then overrides — that divergence is what v1's minBond taught.
cd contracts
PRIVATE_KEY=0x… MIN_BOND_WEI=… PROPOSER_STAKE_WEI=… CHALLENGE_WINDOW=300 \
  forge script script/DeployV2.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast
cd ..

# 3. Point the app at it.
cp .env.example .env.local   # then set the addresses the deploy printed

# 4. Index the registry, and keep it indexed.
npm run index                # merges; a failed run never shrinks coverage

# 5. Run it.
npm run build && npm run start
npm run keeper               # revokes sessions when the contract dismisses
```

**Verify the deployment is honest without trusting the operator:**

```bash
npx mandate-verify --mandate 0 --chain 56 --tamper
```

Exit 0 verified · 1 a real mismatch · 3 no node would serve the evidence. The
third is not the second, and the tool refuses to conflate them.

## 3. Key management

| Key | Can | Cannot |
|---|---|---|
| **Adjudicator** | Propose settlements, publish and revoke assays | Move principal capital. Finalise a challenged epoch. Withdraw a bond |
| **Owner** | Resolve challenges, set parameters, pause | Mint. Withdraw a principal's capital. Take an agent's bond |
| **Principal** | Open, award and close its own mandates | Touch anyone else's |
| **Agent session** | Exactly the calls its assay proved, under a cap, until expiry | Anything else — refused by the wallet with `UnauthorizedCall` |

Rotation is two-step: `nominateAdjudicator`, then the nominee accepts, so a
mistyped address cannot orphan the role.

**The gap, stated plainly: there is no multisig and no timelock on the owner.**
A compromised owner key cannot steal — value moves only by pull payment to the
account it is credited to — but it can resolve challenges wrongly and slash
wrongly. For an adopting team this is the first thing to change, and it is a
deployment decision rather than a contract change: the owner can be a Gnosis
Safe at construction.

## 4. When it breaks

[`docs/INCIDENTS.md`](docs/INCIDENTS.md) covers eight failure modes — RPC
failure mid-settlement, an endpoint dying under a live mandate, a session
expiring with an open position, a fired agent holding a key, either key
compromised, 8004scan down, Greenfield unreachable — each with what the system
does alone, what a human must do, and what is **not** handled.

The pattern throughout: a thing that cannot be measured is recorded as
unknown, never as absent. A rate-limited RPC must not look like a missing
measurement, and it does not.

## 5. The registry gets better whether or not you adopt us

We measured the ERC-8004 Reputation Registry on BSC and found it manufactured:
**3,000 feedback records written by 32 wallets, 99% of them by the 14 that flag
as a coordinated cohort.** On its most-reviewed agent, a published 84.7 becomes
81.1 once that cohort is removed.

Every other reader of that registry routes around it and publishes a better
number somewhere else. **We write back.** Six assays are already in it, each
reproducible from public chain state by anyone, each tagged `mandate-assay` so
a reader who distrusts us can filter every one of ours out in a single pass.

BNB Chain owns that registry. This is the first product that improves the asset
you already own rather than merely consuming it — and it keeps doing so whether
or not this front door is the one anyone uses.

## 6. A metric you can report

The ladder is a KPI, not a page. Every rung is a test the chain settles, so the
counts are auditable by anyone and cannot be inflated by us.

| Rung | Today |
|---|---:|
| 0 Registered | 303,391 |
| 1 Resolvable | ≥3,808 |
| 2 Live | **5** |
| 3 Capable | not measured |
| 4 Assayed | 0 |
| 5 Bonded | 1 |
| 6 Settled | 1 |

**Adoption means driving agents up this ladder**, and progress is a number you
can put in the next AI Agent Landscape post: *"agents at rung 2 went from 5 to
N."* Nobody has climbed it yet — the two agents at rungs 5 and 6 are ours and
are not registry entries — and that gap is the entire opportunity.

## 7. Brand and team

**MANDATE.** The name is the product: an agent holds a mandate, and a mandate
is something that can be withdrawn.

The visual language is the assay office — millesimal fineness, hallmarks, 999
down to 375 — because it is a four-hundred-year-old answer to exactly this
problem: how do you trade a thing whose quality you cannot see, when the seller
has every reason to overstate it? You do not ask the seller. You assay it, and
you strike a mark that means something because striking a false one is a crime.

**Team: one person.** That is the honest answer, and it is why this document
exists — everything here is written so that someone else can run it.

## 8. What this is not

Scope boundaries, so adopting it is not adopting something unbounded.

- **It is not a custodian.** It never holds a principal's keys. Session keys
  bound what an agent may do; the principal's assets stay the principal's.
- **It is not an oracle of agent quality.** Fineness is a measurement of
  specific, named checks against the chain. It is not a rating, and an
  unassayed agent is not accused of anything.
- **It does not decide what a wallet was worth.** v2 makes that assertion cost
  a stake and lets anyone contradict it for the same block. It does not — and a
  contract cannot — settle the disagreement itself. This is the honest limit
  and it is written into the contract's own source.
- **It is not a trading strategy.** The four agents are reference
  implementations that demonstrate the mechanism. One of them loses to holding
  on the window our own input lock chose, and that is published.
- **It is not finished.** [`REBUILD_STATUS.md`](REBUILD_STATUS.md) tracks every
  item against what the repository actually contains, including the ones marked
  TODO and the three blocked on things we cannot supply.

---

## What is not true yet

The section every adoption document should have and most do not.

- **No multisig on the owner.** The largest gap here (§3).
- **No Postgres instance.** The schema and client exist; the site still reads a
  committed snapshot that merges rather than replaces and carries `lastSeen`
  per row. It is a snapshot.
- **The registry sweep is partial.** 3,808 of 303,391, limited by a 25 req/min
  anonymous tier.
- **Bonds are dust.** $0.06. The mechanism is proven end to end on mainnet; it
  has not been tested by an adversary with real money.
- **No demo video.**
- **Tier-3 verification needs an archive node.** Free BSC endpoints serve about
  45 seconds of state, measured.
