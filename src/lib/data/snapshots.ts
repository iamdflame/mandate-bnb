/**
 * Snapshots: the committed JSON files, and their newer selves in Postgres.
 *
 * Every number on the site comes from a snapshot with a `capturedAt`: the
 * probe census, the assays, the registry index. Those used to be files in
 * `src/data/` and nothing else, which meant a deployed instance could only
 * ever show the reading from its last build. With GitHub Actions locked and
 * the Railway worker gone, nothing refreshed them at all.
 *
 * A snapshot now also lives in a `snapshots` table. Readers call `warm()`
 * once at the top of a render; it loads any row newer than what is in memory
 * (cheap: one `select` per snapshot per minute per instance). Writers call
 * `store()`. The committed file remains the floor: a database outage returns
 * the site to its build-time reading and says how old it is, rather than
 * blanking.
 *
 * Readers stay synchronous so the many call sites that already exist keep
 * their shape; `warm()` is the one async step and pages await it first.
