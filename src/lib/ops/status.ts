/**
 * The judge path, checked from the inside.
 *
 * Each of the six beats on /judges depends on a read: the demo address has
 * something to diagnose, every category has an agent that answered, Ranger
 * resolves, Grid-1 has fills, the desk can read the KeyStore, the funnel can
 * read the registry. This runs those reads and grades them, so /status (and
 * any uptime probe pointed at /api/status) sees a broken beat before a judge
 * does. It checks data, not HTML; the smoke script checks the HTML.
