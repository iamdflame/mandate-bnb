/**
 * The clock this deployment does not have.
 *
 * Vercel's hobby plan runs one cron a day, GitHub Actions is billing-locked,
 * and the probe has to be at most fifteen minutes old for anything on the site
 * to claim liveness. So the schedule lives here instead of in a platform: one
 * authorised endpoint (`/api/cron/tick`) is called every few minutes from
 * outside, and this decides which jobs are actually due.
 *
 * Every job records when it last ran and what it said, so `/status` can show
 * the clock rather than assert it, and a job that starts failing is visible as
 * a widening gap rather than as silence.
