/**
 * The ERC-8004 Identity Registry, read from the chain rather than from an index.
 *
 * Every registry figure on this site came through 8004scan, and that is a
 * dependency the product's own thesis will not survive. Three things it does:
 *
 *   It does not have our own registration. Token 336161 was minted at block
 *   120,148,918 and the index answers `Agent not found on chain 56` for it, so
 *   the assay office could not read its own entry.
 *
 *   It returns `DATABASE_ERROR` several times an hour, which is why the front
 *   door's registered count was being served out of a file.
 *
 *   It is lossy. It holds `name: "Agent #269703", description: null` for a
 *   token whose `tokenURI` resolves to a full manifest with a category, a
 *   safety envelope and a live x402 endpoint.
 *
 * The registry is an ERC-721 and the chain answers all three questions itself:
 * `ownerOf` says who holds the identity, `tokenURI` says where the card is,
 * and the card says what the agent claims to be. That read costs two calls
 * against a public node, needs no key, cannot be rate-limited away, and is the
 * same source anyone verifying us would use.
 *
 * `totalSupply` is not among them — this registry does not implement
 * ERC721Enumerable, so the population count still comes from an index and is
 * still stamped as such. Everything about an *individual* agent comes from
 * here.
