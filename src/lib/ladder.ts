/**
 * The Trust Ladder.
 *
 * BNB Chain asked for a front door to every agent on BSC. The honest objection
 * — that a directory lets anyone claim anything at the price of gas — was
 * previously answered by refusing to build a directory. That was intellectually
 * right and strategically wrong: it left every registered agent with nowhere
 * to appear.
 *
 * So every agent appears, and none of them are ranked by what they say. Each
 * sits on a rung, and every rung is a *test the chain can settle*:
 *
 *   0 Registered   it exists in ERC-8004 on BSC
 *   1 Resolvable   its agent card actually parses
 *   2 Live         its endpoint answered a call we made
 *   3 Capable      its wallet has transacted and touched its category's protocols
 *   4 Assayed      a fineness is published on chain, at or above the bar
 *   5 Bonded       it has posted a bond against a live mandate
 *   6 Settled      it has measured, attested epochs behind it
 *
 * The emptiness of the upper rungs is not a gap in the data. It is the finding.
 *
 * Every count here carries the method that produced it, because a funnel whose
 * numbers cannot be re-derived is the same unverifiable claim as an agent card.
