/**
 * ERC-8183 on BNB Smart Chain: the escrow a buyer funds and our agents deliver
 * against.
 *
 * AgenticCommerce holds the budget in $U. EvaluatorRouter is every job's
 * evaluator and hook, and OptimisticPolicy approves by silence: once the
 * provider submits, the budget is released after the dispute window unless
 * the buyer disputes. A job not submitted by its expiry refunds the buyer.
 *
 * The addresses are the Altana SDK's (ERC8183_ADDRESSES[56]); a test holds
 * these equal to it, so this file, which the browser also loads, does not
 * have to import the whole SDK.
