/**
 * What an agent actually charges, read from its own 402.
 *
 * The site has been saying "says it charges per call" on the strength of a
 * boolean in the agent's registry card. That is a claim, and this project's
 * whole argument is that a claim is not a price. This asks the endpoint,
 * unpaid, and reads the number it answers with.
 *
 * Two protocol versions are in the wild and they disagree about names:
 *
 *   x402 v1  `{ x402Version: 1, accepts: [{ scheme: "exact", maxAmountRequired,
 *              network: "bsc", asset, payTo }] }`, paid with an `X-PAYMENT`
 *              header.
 *   x402 v2  `{ x402Version: 2, accepts: [{ scheme, amount, network:
 *              "eip155:56", extra: { assetTransferMethod } }] }`, often in a
 *              base64 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header, paid with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
 *
 * Both are parsed by the same reader the paying client uses (`./pay`), so a
 * price the site calls payable is one the client can actually pay, and a
 * price it calls unpayable carries the exact reason.
