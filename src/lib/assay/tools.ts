/**
 * Whether what an agent can actually do fits the job its card claims.
 *
 * A card is a description anybody can write. The tools an MCP server lists,
 * or the skills an A2A card publishes, are what the software offers when it
 * is asked, which is the closest thing to a capability that can be read
 * without paying. So the probe keeps them, and this compares them with the
 * job the card claims: a grid agent whose server offers `getWeather` and
 * nothing else is a claim the software contradicts.
 *
 * It is deliberately hard to fail. Tools that say nothing about any job
 * (`ping`, `status`, `help`) are set aside, and a tool fits if its name or
 * description names anything the job involves. "Failed" needs tools that
 * were listed and none that fit. An agent that lists no tools is not
 * checked, which is the state of every x402 seller: a price is not a tool
 * list.
