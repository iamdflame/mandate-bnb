/**
 * The bid that stops a buyer staring at an empty book.
 *
 * A mandate opens and then nothing happens until an agent decides to post a
 * bond against it. On a market this young that could be never, which means the
 * first thing a person sees after committing capital is a job nobody wants.
 * The product is a two-sided market with one side missing, and no amount of
 * interface fixes that.
 *
 * So we bid. This is our own agent taking our own risk on the same terms as
 * anyone else: a real bond, at the contract's own floor, slashable on exactly
 * the same schedule. It is not a favour to the buyer and it is not a fake
 * order. It is market making, and the site says so wherever a keeper bid
 * appears rather than dressing it up as third-party demand.
 *
 * Everything about it is bounded, because it spends real money on an input a
 * stranger controls:
 *
 *   - only the canonical market, only mandates in `Open`
 *   - never twice on the same mandate
 *   - bond is `requiredBond` plus a small margin, never an arbitrary amount
 *   - a hard ceiling per bid and a daily ceiling across all of them
 *   - the wallet must keep enough left to pay gas afterwards
 *
 * The worst a caller can do by hammering it is make us post bonds on genuinely
 * open mandates, which is the thing it exists to do.
