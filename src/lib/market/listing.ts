/**
 * What a marketplace card is allowed to say.
 *
 * The brief's example card reads "+13.5% benchmark alpha · Medium risk · From
 * $1/run". Exactly one agent in this registry has ever been hired through
 * Mandate and settled anything, so on this data three thousand eight hundred
 * and seven of those numbers would have to be invented. Inventing them is the
 * one thing a product whose entire argument is "self-reported claims are
 * worthless" cannot do.
 *
 * So this module answers a narrower question, honestly: what do we actually
 * know about this agent, and how did we come to know it? Four grades:
 *
 *   measured   we called it, or the chain told us. Highest confidence.
 *   declared   the agent's own card says so. Useful, unverified, labelled.
 *   absent     we looked and there is nothing. Said out loud, not hidden.
 *   untested   we have not looked yet. Distinct from absent, and it matters.
 *
 * Every signal on a card carries its grade, which is why the cards can be
 * dense without being misleading.
