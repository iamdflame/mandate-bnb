/**
 * One paid call a day to every outside seller a buyer could hire here.
 *
 * The hire law pulls a seller whose last paid call took the money and failed.
 * Waiting for a buyer to find that out costs the buyer. So once a day our
 * trial pool buys one call from each hireable seller we do not run, on the
 * same rail a buyer would use, and records it like any other paid call,
 * flagged as ours: it never counts as anybody's hire, and a failure is
 * attributed to the seller only when the seller is at fault.
 *
 * Capped per call and per day, and skipped with the reason when the pool
 * cannot pay in the seller's token.
