/**
 * Paid calls to agents we do not operate, kept as evidence.
 *
 * A stranger hire over x402 settles the moment the seller submits the
 * transfer: the payment is the settlement, and the answer is the deliverable.
 * Each one is recorded here with the seller's exact bytes, accepted or
 * refused, so the site can show what was bought, from whom, for how much,
 * and what came back, and anyone can check the transfer on BscScan.
 *
 * Rows live in Postgres so a deployment (Judge Mode) can add them, and in
 * `src/data/paid-calls.json` so a clone without a database still shows every
 * call made from the operator's machine. Refusals are kept too: a seller that
 * would not take a correct payment is a finding, not a gap to paper over.
