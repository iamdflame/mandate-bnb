/**
 * How many times each listed agent has actually held a mandate here.
 *
 * `Listing.hires` defaulted to zero and nothing ever passed anything else, so
 * "Hired on this market" read "Not yet" for every agent on the site whether or
 * not it was true. That was harmless only by accident: the answer happens to be
 * zero for all of them, for a reason that is itself worth publishing.
 *
 * The books on this market are held by two wallets we operate. **No agent in
 * the ERC-8004 registry has ever held a mandate here.** The join below is what
 * makes the count correct the moment one does, and `OPERATED_WALLETS` is what
 * lets the site say plainly which rows are ours rather than presenting an
 * in-house book as third-party demand.
 *
 * The bridge from a registry tokenId to the wallet an agent actually signs with
 * is the assay snapshot, which resolves `agentWallet` for 257 of the 258 listed
 * agents. `agents.json` carries only `owner`, which is the NFT holder and
 * frequently a different address.
