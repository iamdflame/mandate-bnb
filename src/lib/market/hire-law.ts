/**
 * The hire law: no honourable path, no button.
 *
 * Every card and profile used to end in a Hire button, whatever stood behind
 * it. For an agent we do not operate, that button opened a job in our own
 * market which only our keeper ever bid on, so "Hire Ranger" hired us. For an
 * agent that had not answered in days, it offered a hire nobody would pick up.
 * A rival could screenshot either and be right.
 *
 * This is the one place that decides, for every surface, whether a hire can
 * be honoured and by which rail:
 *
 *   x402      the agent quoted a price in its own 402 that this marketplace can
 *             pay (BNB Smart Chain, a token we pay in, a transfer method we sign)
 *   mandate   the agent bids in this market, so opening a job here reaches it:
 *             our reference agents, labelled as ours, and any agent that has bid
 *
 * and it requires a recent answer. When no rail exists the verdict carries the
 * reason, in a sentence a person can act on, and the surface shows that
 * instead of a button. Surfaces do not decide this themselves.
