/**
 * A position, what is wrong with it, and who answered when we called them.
 *
 * The two halves of this product have never been joined. One half knows that
 * roughly a quarter of live PancakeSwap V3 positions are sitting outside their
 * range earning nothing; the other half knows which agents answer the phone.
 * Nobody has ever been able to walk in with a position and walk out with an
 * agent, which is the entire transaction this marketplace exists to host.
 *
 * The findings here are deliberately conservative. A position we cannot price
 * is still reported as in or out of range, and a position whose pool we cannot
 * read is reported as unknown rather than guessed at.
