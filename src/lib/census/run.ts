/**
 * The census as a function: call agents, record what came back, merge.
 *
 * `src/scripts/probe-all.ts` did this as a one-shot script that wrote a
 * file. That is right on a laptop and impossible on a serverless function,
 * which has sixty seconds, no writable filesystem, and no scheduler behind
 * it now that GitHub Actions is locked and the Railway worker has stopped.
 *
 * So the census is now incremental and budgeted. A run takes the `limit`
 * agents whose reading is oldest, re-resolves their cards, calls them, and
 * merges the results into the previous reading. Six runs of sixty agents
 * refresh the whole classified set; a judge's own visits (`after()` on the
 * judge-facing pages) and the daily cron are what trigger them. From a
 * laptop `limit` is unbounded and it is the old full census.
 *
 * Two rules from the script survive unchanged. A card that would not resolve
 * is *our* failure and carries its previous reading forward, never
 * overwritten with "no endpoint". And an agent that publishes nothing to
 * call is recorded as publishing nothing, a finding rather than a gap.
