/**
 * Keeps the census fresh from the request path.
 *
 * There is no scheduler behind this deployment right now: GitHub Actions is
 * locked on billing and the Railway worker stopped on 6 September. Vercel's
 * hobby cron runs once a day. So the site refreshes itself from its own
 * traffic: judge-facing pages call `scheduleRefresh()` and, after the
 * response is sent, a budgeted census slice runs if the reading is older
 * than fifteen minutes. One instance at a time, by a lease row in Postgres.
 *
 * The visible effect: a judge who opens `/agents` at 2am sees the reading
 * from fifteen minutes ago at worst, taken by the previous visitor's request,
 * and the age is printed beside every count either way.
