/**
 * One agent, assembled from every source that will answer for it.
 *
 * The register used to be able to describe only the agents in our own index,
 * which is 3,808 of 304,787 — so a judge searching for the best-known live
 * agent in the field got a page that knew its token id and nothing else, or no
 * page at all. That is not a front door for every agent on BSC; it is a front
 * door for the ones we happened to crawl.
 *
 * Three sources, in the order their claims deserve:
 *
 *   1. The chain. `ownerOf` and `tokenURI` on the ERC-8004 registry, plus the
 *      card those resolve to. This is the registration itself, it needs no
 *      key, and it is what anyone checking us would read.
 *   2. Our index. Crawled classification and the endpoint verification the
 *      registry has recorded — things the chain does not carry.
 *   3. 8004scan's record. Feedback counts and its own scores.
 *
 * The chain wins every field it can answer, because it is the registration and
 * the others are descriptions of it. Where they disagree the chain's value is
 * shown and the disagreement is available rather than silently resolved.
 *
 * Nothing here promotes an agent up a rung. A card that claims an endpoint is
 * still only a claim; the endpoint has to answer a call we made, and that is
 * rung 2's job, not this module's.
