/**
 * Bounded delegation, via Altana ERC-8183 session keys.
 *
 * This is the half of the mandate that was missing. Until now an agent won a
 * mandate and then "traded off-vault", which in practice meant it did nothing
 * and the adjudicator invented a number. A mandate now carries real authority:
 *
 *   - a spend cap, no larger than the capital under mandate
 *   - a call allowlist bound to target *and* selector, containing only the
 *     protocols the agent's category actually needs
 *   - an expiry that ends with the mandate's term
 *   - revocation, which is the same event as being dismissed
 *
 * The principal keeps its keys. The agent gets a scoped session key and can do
 * nothing else with it. That is the whole point: the bond makes an agent
 * accountable for outcomes, and the session makes it incapable of anything
 * outside its brief.

 *     are absent on purpose.
 *   - MasterChef `harvest(uint256,address)` was here and is gone: its second
