/**
 * The four house leashes, in one table.
 *
 * Each reference agent acts on the demo account through a session, and a
 * session expires: that is the point of it. What was missing was anything
 * that noticed. Guard-1, Yield-1 and Grid-1 all lapsed on 12 September and
 * nobody saw it for six days, because a lapsed session does not fail loudly.
 * It just stops being authority, and the agent goes quiet.
 *
 * The leashes were written out longhand in three different scripts, so
 * renewing one meant finding the script that granted it and copying its
 * arguments. They live here now, so `renewHouseSessions` can renew any of
 * them without knowing which agent it is renewing, and the scheduler can run
 * that before expiry rather than after.
