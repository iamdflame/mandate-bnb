    Nothing is asked of the wallet until somebody asks for the wallet.

    This used to call `eth_accounts` on mount, on the reasoning that reading
    the authorised accounts is not a request for permission. That reasoning is
    correct about the JSON-RPC method and wrong about what actually happens:
    several multi-chain wallets, Phantom among them, injected as
    `window.ethereum`, surface their own connect overlay on the first provider
    call from an unknown origin, whatever the method is. So opening the front
    page of an assay office threw a wallet popup at the reader, which for a
    site asking to be trusted with capital is the single worst first impression
    available.

    The provider is only touched after a deliberate act. The presence check is
    a property read, which reaches no extension. If this browser has connected
    to this origin before, the silent `eth_accounts` reflection happens then
    and only then, a returning user keeps the convenience and a first-time
    visitor gets no dialogue at all.

 * at MandateMarket**V2**; `MANDATE_MARKET_ABI` describes **V1**. Their
 * signatures are not compatible: V2's `openMandate` takes twelve arguments
 * where V1's takes six, `bid` four where V1 takes two, `withdraw` one where V1
 * takes none.
 *
 * The consequence was total. `simulateContract` runs before the wallet is ever
 * asked for a signature, so every write reverted with `execution reverted: 0x`
 *, the chain saying "no such function", and the user saw a dead button and no
 * wallet prompt. Not a degraded hire path: no hire path at all.
 *
 * Verified against mainnet: V1's `openMandate` selector reverts on
 * `0x6052C0ab…71B2` and succeeds on `0xeD331c44…1544`, and the former answers
 * `paused()` and `proposerStake()`, which only V2 has.
 *
 * So the target is now explicit at every call site. The book already carries a
 * `deploymentAddress` per row, mandates from three deployments share one table
 *, and passing it here is what stops a bid on a superseded row being sent to
