/**
 * Every market this office has run, named.
 *
 * There are three, and until now the site could not say so coherently: the
 * footer linked one, `/start` printed a second, the README claimed a third,
 * and the verifier defaulted to a fourth answer. A visitor comparing them
 * would have found three different contracts all describing themselves as *the*
 * market.
 *
 * The instinct is to pick the newest and delete the others. That would be
 * wrong here, because all three hold real mandates with real settled epochs,
 * including the grid mandate that lost 21% — and a market that quietly stops
 * displaying its worst result when it redeploys is doing the precise thing this
 * product exists to catch.
 *
 * So: one canonical deployment that new mandates open on, and every earlier
 * deployment kept, labelled, and still readable. The book spans all of them.
