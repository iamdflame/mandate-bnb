/**
 * The agents this office operates itself, and the wallets they act from.
 *
 * The register's top rungs were occupied by two bare addresses. They hold
 * mandates, settle epochs and get slashed, but they are not ERC-8004
 * identities, so the funnel had to say, in the product's own words, that "the
 * registry's population and the market's do not yet overlap at all". A
 * marketplace whose only bonded participants are outside the registry it
 * indexes is a studio with a directory attached.
 *
 * These wallets are registered as ERC-8004 identities so that the tokenId and
 * the holder are the same thing, and rung 5 counts registrations rather than
 * addresses.
 *
 * One identity per wallet, not one per office. 0xd6d11Aa5 holds mandates in
 * all four offices, and minting four registrations for it would have made rung
 * five read `4` for one participant, the same manufactured plurality this
 * register flags when one wallet holds forty-four BORT tokens. The card names
 * every office the wallet actually works in, and the count stays honest.
