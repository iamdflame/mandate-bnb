/**
 * Every table this deployment needs, created once, in order.
 *
 * Each module used to create its own table on first use. That is tidy until
 * several of them run inside one render: `/status` reads sessions, snapshots,
 * schedules, samples and paid calls at the same time, so five `create table if
 * not exists` statements went out concurrently over a pool of five
 * connections, took catalog locks, and waited on each other. The page stopped
 * answering at all, which is a far worse failure than a missing table, and it
 * only happened in production because only production runs them together.
 *
 * So creation happens here: one promise, one statement at a time, shared by
 * every caller and paid once per instance. Readers that arrive while it is
 * running wait for it rather than issuing their own.
