/**
 * Every table this deployment needs, created once, in order.
 *
 * Each module used to create its own table on first use. That is tidy until
 * several of them run inside one render: `/status` reads sessions, snapshots,
 * schedules, samples and paid calls at the same time, so five `create table if
 * not exists` statements went out concurrently over a pool of five
 * connections, took catalog locks, and waited on each other. The page stopped
 * answering at all, which is a far worse failure than a missing table, and it
 * only happened in production because only production runs them together.
 *
 * So creation happens here: one promise, one statement at a time, shared by
 * every caller and paid once per instance. Readers that arrive while it is
 * running wait for it rather than issuing their own.

  What the catalogue says about our tables, in one round trip.

  This used to run ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY and REVOKE on all
  fourteen tables on every cold start of every instance. That cost about five
  seconds of sequential round trips, and worse, ALTER TABLE takes an access
  exclusive lock: while one instance's ALTER waits behind any open transaction,
  every ordinary SELECT on that table from every other instance queues behind
  the ALTER. A marketplace page that reads paid calls then waits for minutes,
  which is what a local run hit once the catalogue started reading them.

  So it asks first. A table that exists, has row-level security, and grants
  nothing to the public roles needs nothing, which after the first run is all
  of them, and a cold start costs one catalogue read.
