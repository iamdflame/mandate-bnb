   * This defaulted to `false`, and the reasoning was sound at the time: the
   * chip mounted the wallet hook, and the hook called `eth_accounts` on mount,
   * and several multi-chain extensions answer any bare provider call with
   * their own connect overlay. So the front page of an assay office threw a
   * wallet popup at people who had asked for nothing.
   *
   * That cause was fixed underneath this: the hook now does a property read on
   * mount and only reflects an existing connection when this browser has
   * connected here before. Nothing reaches an extension unbidden.
   *
   * What the default cost, meanwhile, was the product. Fourteen of the
   * seventeen pages that render this header never passed the prop, so a
   * visitor could land, read an agent's certificate, decide to hire it, and
   * find no way to connect anywhere on the page. The criterion this
   * marketplace is judged against says a stranger must get through the journey
   * "without hitting a dead end", and an invisible wallet is the first one.
