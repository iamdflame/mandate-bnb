/**
 * Paying an agent for one answer, without committing capital.
 *
 * Two things had to be true before this could be honest. The price had to be
 * measured rather than declared, which it now is: the census asks every
 * endpoint that answers 402 what it charges and commits the reply. And the
 * button had to be able to actually settle, which depends on the agent
 * speaking a protocol we can sign.
 *
 * Where it does, the call runs end to end and the buyer needs no BNB. Where it
 * does not, this says exactly which part we cannot satisfy and links to the
 * endpoint so a person can pay it themselves. A button that fails when pressed
 * is worse than a sentence explaining why there is no button.
