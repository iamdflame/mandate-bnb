/**
 * Hiring an agent, in four steps, with nothing hidden in any of them.
 *
 * The old route asked for one number and a category on a single screen, then
 * put a signature in front of a stranger who had not been told what the
 * signature did. Everything else, the tolerance, the term, the strike count,
 * the slash, was hardcoded out of sight and never named.
 *
 * Here every one of those is a choice, phrased as a question about the job
 * rather than as a contract parameter, and step three restates the whole
 * arrangement in English with the worst case in money before anything is
 * signed. That last screen is the point of the flow. A person should never
 * find out what they agreed to by reading a block explorer afterwards.
 *
 * The contract's real constraints are enforced here rather than discovered at
 * the revert: an epoch has to outlast the challenge window, strikes cannot be
 * zero, the catastrophic threshold has to be negative, and a mandate under
 * 0.0002 BNB has a bond floor beneath the market's minimum, so no agent could
 * bid on it even if it opened.
