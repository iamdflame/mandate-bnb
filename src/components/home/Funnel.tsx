/**
 * The funnel is the hero, and it is drawn to scale.
 *
 * It used to be a list of right-aligned numerals, which meant the single most
 * important fact about this registry — that three hundred thousand
 * registrations collapse to five reachable agents and then to nothing — had to
 * be worked out by reading. Now the bar does it: rung 0 fills the track, rung 1
 * is a one-percent sliver, and everything below it is a hairline. Nobody has to
 * be told.
 *
 * The scale is linear and deliberately not logarithmic. A log axis would make
 * the lower rungs comfortably visible and would be a kindness to the data at
 * the cost of the truth: the collapse really is that severe, and softening it
 * would be arguing for ourselves.
 *
 * Rendered on the server, with the figures in the first byte of HTML.
 *
 * This was a client component that counted each rung up from zero on mount and
 * grew each bar from zero width. Both were entrance flourishes, and the price
 * of them was that the server-rendered ladder — the thing a judge, a crawler
 * and a preview card actually see — read `Registered 0 · Live 0 · Bonded 0`
 * underneath a sentence saying 303,391 agents are registered. The market's own
 * front door reported the market was empty, and the API beside it did not.
 *
 * There is no state left here, so there is nothing to hydrate and nothing that
 * can disagree with the HTML. `BRAND.md` forbids load counters outright; the
 * bug and the doctrine had the same fix.
