/**
 * Yield routing between venues.
 *
 * Reads the supply rate actually being paid on Venus and compares it against
 * the position's current placement, moving only when the difference clears the
 * cost of moving. That last clause is the whole strategy: a router that chases
 * every basis point of headline APR pays more in gas and slippage than the
 * spread it captured, which is the most common way yield optimisers lose money
 * while reporting that they are winning.
 *
 * Venus quotes `supplyRatePerBlock` in 1e18 units per block. BSC produces
 * roughly 28.8m blocks a year at 1.095s, which is the multiplier used here.
