/**
 * Health factor monitoring on Venus.
 *
 * Watches a lending position's distance to liquidation and acts before the
 * liquidators do. Most of the time the correct action is none, and the value
 * of the agent is entirely in the epochs where it is not: this is the category
 * where doing nothing well matters more than trading often.
 *
 * Venus reports `getAccountLiquidity` as (error, liquidity, shortfall) in USD
 * with 18 decimals. Liquidity is the borrowing headroom left; shortfall is
 * non-zero only once the position is already liquidatable, which is too late.
 * So the trigger is headroom falling below a fraction of the borrow, not
 * shortfall appearing.
