/**
 * Grid trading on PancakeSwap V3.
 *
 * The strategy is deliberately the plain one: anchor a set of price levels
 * around a reference, buy the asset as price crosses down through a level and
 * sell as it crosses up through one. It makes money from oscillation and loses
 * to trend, which is exactly the honest behaviour to put in front of a
 * benchmark — a grid that beats hold in a chop and trails it in a rally is a
 * real result, and inventing something that always wins was the thing this
 * whole rebuild exists to stop doing.
 *
 * Every swap is `exactInputSingle` on the V3 router, which is the one selector
 * this category's session key is allowed to call.
