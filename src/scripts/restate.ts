/**
 * Re-runs every settled epoch in mainnet history through the corrected gauge.
 *
 * The old valuation read native BNB and USDT and nothing else, so an agent
 * that put capital to work — into a V3 position, a Venus supply, even a WBNB
 * wrap — was measured as having lost it. Slashes were taken on those
 * measurements. This finds out which ones were wrong, and by how much.
 *
 * It re-derives from public chain state alone. That is the whole point, and it
 * is also the constraint: re-deriving a valuation at a past block needs archive
 * state, and no free BSC endpoint serves it. Without one this reports what it
 * can establish and states plainly what it cannot, rather than guessing at the
 * half it cannot see — which is the same failure it exists to correct.
