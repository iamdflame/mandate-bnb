/**
 * The clock's tick, called from outside.
 *
 *   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://mandate-coral.vercel.app/api/cron/tick
 *
 * Point any external pinger at this every five minutes. It decides what is
 * due (see lib/ops/schedule) rather than trusting the caller's cadence, so a
 * pinger that fires late or twice cannot double-run a job or skip one.
 *
 * Authorised callers only: the jobs write to the database and one of them
 * spends a little gas, so an open endpoint would be somebody else's budget.
