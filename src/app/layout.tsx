  Fonts are self-hosted rather than fetched by `next/font/google`.

  The Google fetch is a build-time network dependency, and it was intermittently
  timing out here, which fails the build in a way that surfaces as an unrelated
  null-context error during prerender. Self-hosting removes the dependency
  entirely, drops a third-party request at runtime, and makes the build
  reproducible offline.
