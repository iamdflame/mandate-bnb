/**
 * A reference agent's ERC-8004 registration file, at the URL its token points to.
 *
 * registration-v1, with `services` named the way our own assay reads them: an
 * `x402` service the census will call (and get a 402 with a price), an A2A
 * card, the MCP endpoint, and the page that shows its work. Every claim here is
 * one the six checks will test within minutes of the registration landing.
