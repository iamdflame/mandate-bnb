/**
 * A house agent's A2A card, at the URL its ERC-8004 registration points at.
 *
 * The registration is what the assay tests, so this card is written to be
 * checked rather than to score. Every claim in it is one this office's own
 * six tests will run against the chain within minutes: the wallet is named, so
 * custody and activity are checkable; the offices are the ones the book
 * actually shows mandates in; and the skill it advertises is served by the
 * endpoint beside it, so rung 2 is earned by answering rather than asserted.
 *
 * A card that overstated any of this would fail its author's own capability
 * check in public, on the page that lists it.
