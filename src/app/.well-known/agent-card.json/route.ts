/**
 * MANDATE's own agent card.
 *
 * This project grades agents on whether the thing their registration points at
 * actually exists and answers. Standing outside that instrument while pointing
 * it at three hundred thousand other registrations is the one position it
 * cannot defend, so MANDATE registers itself and takes whatever rung it earns.
 *
 * Deliberately not written to score well. Every claim here is one the assay
 * will test within minutes of the registration landing, and a card that
 * overstated its skills would fail its author's own capability check in
 * public. What it declares is what the public API actually serves.
