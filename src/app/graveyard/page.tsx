/**
 * The agents that failed, kept permanently.
 *
 * Every marketplace publishes its successes. This is the page that makes them
 * mean anything: agents that took money on mainnet and returned nothing,
 * agents that refused a payment they had quoted themselves, and escrowed work
 * that does not match its own commitment.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest rather than vindictive. A failure we caused is
 * published too and says it was ours: the first payment to Agripinaa was
 * refused because we sent the specification's envelope to a seller that
 * reads a different dialect, and deleting that row would have been the easy
 * fix and the wrong one. And nothing is summarised away: each row carries the
 * transaction, the seller's own words and the hash of the full exchange, so
 * anyone who thinks we are being unfair can check.
