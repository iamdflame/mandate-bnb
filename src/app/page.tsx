  The front door is revalidated, not rendered per request.

  It was `force-dynamic` with the ladder and the book behind Suspense, and that
  combination is what a judge with JavaScript off actually saw: React streams a
  boundary by painting the fallback in place and appending the real content in
  a `<div hidden>` that only a script moves. So the served HTML said "reading
  the chain" above four doors that said "reading the book", and the true
  figures — which were in the document — were never displayed.

  Awaiting them in the body puts the figures in the markup where they are read.
  Doing that on every request would spend a chain read on each visitor and cost
  the four seconds that decide whether they stay, so the page is cached and
  re-read every thirty seconds instead. Every figure carries the block and the
  age it was read at, so a cached number is never presented as a live one.
*/

/*
  The funnel streams.

  Rung 4 scans event logs from the deploy block in 4,000-block windows, because
  free BSC providers refuse anything wider, and that is eleven seconds. Awaiting
  it in the page body meant the front door did not paint at all until the scan
  finished — the worst eleven seconds in the product, spent on the one visitor
  who has not decided to stay yet.

  So the mark, the name and the positioning line arrive at once, and the figures
  land underneath them when the chain answers. A rung that is still being read
  says so; it never shows a number it has not got.
